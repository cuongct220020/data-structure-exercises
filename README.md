* **Ex1 - order management:** Using singly linked list to build business logic for order management application.

* **Ex2 - xml parser:** Using tree data structure simulates the process of building an XML tree. Also apply the stack data structure for the tag matching operation.

* **Ex3 - memory management:** Using singly linked list simulates the way the operating system manages free space by applying first fit, best fit, next fit, worst fit strategies.

* **Ex4 - cache management:** Use Doubly Linked List and Hash Table to simulate how cache management algorithms like: LRU, MRU, MFU work.

* **Ex5 - prefix tree:** Use the Trie (Prefix Tree) data structure to build two programs that simulate how a spell checker and an autocomplete suggestion system work.

* **Ex6 - variable scope management:** Using the tree data structure simulates the behavior of the compiler. From there, build a scope tree structure, identify and check the validity of variables in the program.

* **Ex7 - document clustering:** Using MinHash + Locality Sensitive Hash (LSH) technique to solve the document clustering problem. 

* **Ex8 - user session management:** Using Red-Black Tree data structure simulates the operation of web server in managing user sessions when they log in on different devices.
